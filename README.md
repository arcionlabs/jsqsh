# Welcome to JSqsh

JSqsh (pronounced jay-skwish) is short for Java SQl Shell, a console
based tool that allows the ability to query a database with functionality
of your typical shell, such as command line editing, tab completion, variable 
expansion, redirection of output to files, or the ability to pipe the output 
of the query execution to an external program (grep, more, etc.).

JSqsh has extensive built-in documentation, however for those that prefer
point-and-click learning, you can get an introduction to jsqsh using
